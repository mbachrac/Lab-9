#Answers for Lab 9

**1**

A)The words appear the same amount of times no matter what map I use.
   
B) All three of the maps seem to run the same way and none are more efficient than the others.

**2**. They are basically the same. Using % makes the same answer whether one or two or non of the numbers are negative. Math.floorMod has a different answer if one of the numbers is negative. Math.floorMod is better here because here we could catch if the word is supposed to go into a negative spot.

**3**. MyHashMap.size() has a complexity of O(n) where n is the table size. We could make the size method more efficient by counting the size as we make the hashMap. As we find a place/ bucket to put each key- value pair, we could count the number of words.

**4** Both classes performed the same way. This one took a little longer to set up but they both were correct and reliable.
